# CSE Todo App

This is a simple, client-side encrypted todo web app, inspired by TodoMVC, and supported by SvelteKit.
It has basic CRUD abilites, meaning you can create, view, update and delete your todos.

Authentication runs over RSA, specifically being in knowledge of the respective private key, which is generated for you when creating a new user on the webpage. Only that private key allows you to access your data later on other devices (or if you reset your browser data).

A live demo can be found [here](https://cse-todo.vercel.app) (hosted on Vercel).

## Application Architecture

The rough application architecture can be seen below or in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMfS435HpT5ICBRcgiRqN9r_kv8vFhAE/view?usp=sharing) collection of diagrams.

The application uses MongoDB as a backend database, although you could also use every other database supported by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started#prisma-with-different-tooling).

The most demanding part here was solving all the authentication/cryptography on the browser side, like generating the public key from the private key, generating a key pair as a whole etc.
For this, the frontend utilizes [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge), a native implementation of many cryptographic tools.

## Getting started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flawnn/E2EETodo.git
```

2. Set the needed environment variables in `.env`, as following (see `.env.example`)

```env
DATABASE_URL="..."
JWT_SECRET="..."
```

3. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server with hot reload

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server with hot reload enabled. You can now make changes to the code and see the changes immediately in the browser.

Optionally you can run `npm run build` to generate needed files for a production deployment.

## Known Bugs

‚ùó Using the App simultaneously on two devices isn't advised as they'll overwrite the encrypted data on the server with their own local state. Meaning, having changed a todo on one device, doesn't reflect on the other one until you refresh the page. Be aware of that
